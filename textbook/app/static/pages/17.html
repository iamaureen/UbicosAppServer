        <li>What does each point on the line represent?</li>
        <li>What is the rate of change for the graph? What is a rule (equation) you can use to describe any point on this line?</li>
        <li>What does a rate of change on a graph mean? What does it mean specifically for this graph? What did we discover? </li>
        <li>Is constant speed proportional? Explain your thinking. Do you agree with each boardâ€™s rationale?</li>
