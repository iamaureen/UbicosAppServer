   We want to help you become better collaborators so:
        <li> you can support each other in your learning </li>
        <li> to help you become more active learners </li>
        <li> to help you construct your own STEM knowledge </li>

    By participating in this study you are helping us to design the technology and curriculum. We will be asking you for your help along the way.
    It’s OK if it’s hard to participate. We hope the tech works. If it doesn’t, let us know! It really helps us.
