</p>

<p>
    Working as a group in Paint Splash in the single paint splash mode, create a paint splash of your choice. Your group needs to agree on the color.
    Each group member should then use the double paint splash setting to recreate your group’s paint splash on the left.
    And then on the right create either a larger or smaller matching batch (each group member should create a different sized matching paint splash on the right).

</p>

<p>
    Now that you are done, enter all the group members ratios into a
    <a href="#" class="table" data-id="1" data-heading="Paint Splash">Paint Splash Table</a>.
    <a class="activity-button table" data-id="1" data-heading="Circle Table"></a>

</p>

    Remember, your
    <a class="whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a>
    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url=""></a>
    needs:
    <ul>
        <li> A Title</li>
        <li> A screenshot of one person’s double paint splash (2 different sized batches) (check here how to take screenshot)</li>
        <li> A Screenshot of the table that lists your group members’ batches </li>
        <li> A screenshot of your graph </li>
        <li> A written explanation about how you know how to find any size batch for your color. </li>
        <li> A rule in words and numbers.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Upload Your Model
Take a screenshot of your solution whiteboard and upload the screenshot in the Perfect Purple Paint Gallery #2.
Every member of your group will upload an image of your groups’ board.
