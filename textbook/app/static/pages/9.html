    With your group members,
    <ul>
        <li>Discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship between the red and blue paint.</li>
        <li>Does the way the group represented it change the color of the paint?</li>
        <li>How did people represent their perfect purple paint? Do different peopleâ€™s representations
            mean the same thing? How are the representations (drawings, numbers, etc.) related?</li>
    </ul>
