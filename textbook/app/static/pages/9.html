<h1>Create your own color</h1>

<p>
    I love my Perfect Purple Paint, but you probably want to come up with your own awesome color for your house. Check out

    Paint Splash</a> here!

</p>

<p>
    Working as a group in Paint Splash in the single paint splash mode, create a paint splash of your choice. Your group needs to agree on the color.
    Each group member should then use the double paint splash setting to recreate your group’s paint splash on the left.
    And then on the right create either a larger or smaller matching batch (each group member should create a different sized matching paint splash on the right).
</p>

<p> Use the
    <a class="chatCard" data-id="2" data-heading="Chat">group chat</a> to discuss about the paint splash colors.
    <a class="activity-button chatCard" data-id="2" data-heading="Chat"> </a>
</p>


<p>
    Now that you are done, enter all the group members ratios into a
    <a href="#" class="table" data-id="2" data-heading="Paint Splash">Paint Splash Table</a>.
    <a class="activity-button table" data-id="2" data-heading="Circle Table"></a>

</p>

<p>
    Remember, your
    <a class="whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a>
    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url=""></a>
    needs:
    <ul>
        <li> A Title</li>
        <li> A screenshot of one person’s double paint splash (2 different sized batches) </li>
        <li> A Screenshot of the table that lists your group members’ batches </li>
        <li> A screenshot of your graph </li>
        <li> A written explanation about how you know how to find any size batch for your color. </li>
        <li> A rule in words and numbers.</li>
    </ul>
