<h1>Buggy Lab Discussion</h1>

<p>
    Let's go to the
     <a href="#" class="individual" data-id="3" data-heading="Buggy Lab Gallery">Buggy Lab Gallery</a>

    and look at the whiteboards of the other groups.


    Make sure to think about how they have presented their information.
</p>

<p>
     Now, let's move to the
    <a class="gallery" data-description="What does a rate of change on a graph mean? What does it mean specifically for this graph? What did we discover?"
       data-heading="Buggy Lab Gallery" data-id="3"
       href="#">Buggy Lab digital group discussion</a>.
    <a class="activity-button gallery" data-description="What does a rate of change on a graph mean? What does it mean specifically for this graph? What did we discover?" data-heading="Buggy Gallery"
       data-id="3" href="#"> </a>
        With your digital group-members, discuss the following:
    <ul>
        <li>What does each point on the line represent?</li>
        <li>What is the rate of change for the graph? What is a rule (equation) you can use to describe any point on this line?</li>
        <li>What does a rate of change on a graph mean? What does it mean specifically for this graph? What did we discover? </li>
        <li>Is constant speed proportional? Explain your thinking. Do you agree with each boardâ€™s rationale?</li>

    </ul>
