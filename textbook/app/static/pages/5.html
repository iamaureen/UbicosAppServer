    I’ve found the perfect color to paint my house. It’s made by mixing two cups of blue paint with three cups of red paint. That makes one batch of <strong>
    Perfect Purple Paint</strong>.

    I know it will take at least 20 cups to paint my bathroom. I don’t want to make a bunch of small batches.
    How much of each color will I need to paint the entire bathroom?

    Let’s make a model using the Unifix Cube blocks to represent the information in this problem. Have one color block represent red paint
    and another color block represent blue paint. Open the

    show how you could make 20 cups of purple paint using this tool.
