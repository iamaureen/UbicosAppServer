<h1>Discuss your Model</h1>



<p>
    A member from each group will take a screenshot of their <a class="whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a> solution. Then upload the screenshot
    <a class="assignment" href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/S622Zg16WzXge0X4Ruuf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    Let's look at the different whiteboards together.

</p>

<p>
    Now,  move to the

    <a class="chatCard" data-id="2" data-heading="Chat">group chat</a> to discuss about your whiteboard and the solution you came up with.
    <a class="activity-button chatCard" data-id="2" data-heading="Chat"> </a>

    With your group members,
    <ul>
        <li>Discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship between the red and blue paint.</li>
        <li>Does the way the group represented it change the color of the paint?</li>
        <li>How did people represent their perfect purple paint? Do different peopleâ€™s representations
            mean the same thing? How are the representations (drawings, numbers, etc.) related?</li>
    </ul>
