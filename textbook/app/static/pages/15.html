<h1>Buggy Lab: Make a Whiteboard</h1>

    <p>
        As a group, create a

        <a class="whiteboard" data-id="3" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a>
        <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="3" data-video-url="">
        </a>
        with as many representations of the data as you can show. The whiteboard should include:
        <ul>
            <li> Data table  </li>
            <li> Graph with units and labels </li>
            <li> The story of the car. What did you observe? How did it move? How do you know? </li>
            <li> Is this a proportional relationship? Be prepared to defend your thinking! </li>
            <li> A rule in words and numbers that describes this relationship </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
