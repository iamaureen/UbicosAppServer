<h1>Proportion Problems Brainstorm</h1>

<p>
    So far we have solved a painting problem with ratios and proportions. We wanted to keep the same color no matter what size batch we needed.
    Let's brainstorm other types of problems we might solve using what we know about ratios and proportions.

<div class="page-section-border">
    <h4> Accuracy with a Stopwatch</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
             If you have access to a stopwatch/cellphone/clock with a second hand, have it available for timing in this activity.
        </li>
        <li>
            When I say to begin, start your stopwatch at the same time. Then, be ready to stop when I say stop.â€©
        </li>
    </ul>

    Let's discuss what we observed from this from activity!
