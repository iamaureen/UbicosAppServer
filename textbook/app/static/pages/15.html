            <li> Graph with units and labels </li>
            <li> The story of the car. What did you observe? How did it move? How do you know? </li>
            <li> Is this a proportional relationship? Be prepared to defend your thinking! </li>
            <li> A rule in words and numbers that describes this relationship </li>
        </ul>
