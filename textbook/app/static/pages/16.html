<h1>Buggy Lab Discussion</h1>


<p> Let's look at the different whiteboards together. We want to discuss the following:

    <ul>
        <li>What does each point on the line represent?</li>
        <li>What is the rate of change for the graph? What is a rule (equation) you can use to describe any point on this line?</li>
        <li>What does a rate of change on a graph mean? What does it mean specifically for this graph? What did we discover? </li>
        <li>Is constant speed proportional? Explain your thinking. Do you agree with each boardâ€™s rationale?</li>
        <li> Is constant speed proportional? </li>
        <li> What are we looking for to see if this relationship is proportional? </li>
        <li> Why do we make graphs of data? </li>
        <li> Why do we write equations of lines? </li>

    </ul>
</p>

    Based on the discussion, are there any change you would like to make in your
    <a class="whiteboard" data-id="3" data-video-url="">Buggy Lab Whiteboard</a>?
