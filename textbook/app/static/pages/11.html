<h1>Paint Splash Whiteboard Meeting</h1>

<p>
    Now that we have discussed as a class, is there anything you would change on your
    <a class="whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url="">whiteboard tool</a>
    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="2" data-video-url=""></a> based on your classmates' feedback?
    What can you change to make your board more clear?

    If you do not yet have a rule on your board, do your best to add one.
    Think about how you would find the number of cups of each color needed for any size room.

            We want to make sure we all agree on the terms we are using.
            Are there any words we need to define as a class?
            We can discuss these terms using the
            <a class="whiteboard" data-id="0" data-video-url="">Model-So-Far page</a>.
