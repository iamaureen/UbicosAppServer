    Look at other student's solutions in the
    <a href="#" class="individual" data-id="2" data-heading="Paint Splash Gallery"
               data-description="" >Paint Splash Gallery</a> and leave a comment on each picture.
    Ask a question for clarification, give a compliment, or explain what you are thinking. Be specific.
    Do you understand/agree with their solutions?

    Once you have commented individually, move to the
    <a class="gallery" data-description="Discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship between the red and blue paint."
       data-heading="Paint Splash Gallery" data-id="2"
       href="#">group discussion</a>.
    <a class="activity-button gallery" data-description="Discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship between the red and blue paint." data-heading="Paint Splash Gallery" data-id="2"
       href="#"> </a>
    With your classmates,
    <ul>
        <li>Discuss the similarities and differences between the way groups represented the relationship between the red and blue paint.</li>
        <li>Does the way the group represented it change the color of the paint?</li>
        <li>How did people represent their perfect purple paint? Do different people’s representations
            mean the same thing? How are the representations (drawings, numbers, etc.) related?</li>
    </ul>
