<h1>Help Cobi</h1>

<p>
    Part of this project is having you teach a computer “agent,” or program.
    When you are teaching someone else, it is often helpful to know the process and the answers before you begin.

    Solve the problems in your <a class="assignment" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yBVblVHfOujNSQ3P0GHk96bnWpRvAiqQXNGFQkKYrI8/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">workbook</a> Pg. 5 through Pg. 8
    in preparation for helping this computerized student Cobi.
