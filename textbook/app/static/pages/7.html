<h1>Refine your Model</h1>

    <p>
        Let's discuss your whiteboards as a class.
        Keep in mind the suggestions from the badges to ask good questions and make productive comments.

    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Would it help us to be able to visualize these numbers? What are ways we can see whatâ€™s happening with data?</li>
        <li>What is our data telling us?</li>
        <li>How can you prove to me that it will make the same color? </li>
        <li>Can we write a rule for this in words?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        We want to make sure we all agree on the terms we are using.
        Are there any words we need to define as a class?
        We can discuss terms using the Vocabulary section of the Model-So-Far page.
