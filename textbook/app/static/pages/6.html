<h1>Explain Your Model</h1>

<p>
    Paste your Unifix screenshot on this
    <a class="whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="">whiteboard</a> tool. As you make your whiteboard, think about these questions:
    <a class="activity-button whiteboard" data-id="1" data-video-url="">
    </a> <br/>

<ul>
    <li>How do you know the color will be the same in the small batch as it is in the larger batch?</li>
    <li>Can you find multiple ways to model this relationship?</li>
    <li>Can you write a rule (using words or numbers) to create this color of paint that anyone could follow
    for any number of cups?</li>
    <li>Explain your thinking in words and draw arrows or labels to help others understand your thinking.</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p> Use the
    <a class="chatCard" data-id="1" data-heading="Chat">group chat</a> to discuss about your whiteboard and the solution you come up with.
    <a class="activity-button chatCard" data-id="1" data-heading="Chat"> </a>
